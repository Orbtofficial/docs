This section will be completed when ORBT token details are finalized. Recommended outline:

- Supply and Distribution: initial supply, allocations, vesting, cliffs
- Emissions: schedules, sinks/sources, on-chain enforcement
- Utility: governance, fee discounts, staking, credit boosts (if any)
- Alignment: treasury policies and risk controls tied to token incentives
