### Treasury Model

The treasury accumulates protocol revenues in both underlying tokens and Ox. Policies should specify:

- Asset Management
  - Hold Ox for liquidity incentives or burn/buyback policies (TBD)
  - Convert underlying fees to stable assets based on risk policy

- Spending Policies
  - Audits, bug bounties, operations, liquidity programs
  - Governance-approved budgets with reporting

- Reporting
  - Monthly revenue breakdown by source and asset
  - Mark-to-market of Ox holdings and underlying balances
