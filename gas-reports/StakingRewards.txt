Notes and caveats:
- Per-function exact gas requires isolated tests; above values reflect full test flows. Use them as representative/upper bounds for the invoked paths.
- `exit()` includes internal `withdraw` and `getReward`, so its gas is naturally higher.
- Admin update gas can vary based on state (mid-period vs idle; first-time set vs update).
- Event-heavy paths (e.g., referral) add marginal cost.

If you want, I can add dedicated micro-tests to isolate `stake` vs `withdraw` vs `getReward` individually to produce exact per-function gas numbers.
